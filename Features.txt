Include date for sighting

Quick-add feature: Go to another user's page, who has an entry for a sighting that you shared, click a button to add it to your page, along with editing of details.  //this should be just like editing a post, but the insert() will go into a different user's data.

Additional sightings of the same bird
 -
**  - make bird/user a multiple to multiple join table...one entry per bird, one bird can be seen by many users, and a user can see many birds.
    - then, additional sightings by the same user of the same bird could be added.

location
 - May want to add a table for location...by neighborhood, gps coordinates, town, park name?
